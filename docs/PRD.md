# Product Requirements Document: DL Starter Template

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-09
**Status**: Active

---

## Problem Statement

Building production-ready SaaS applications requires solving the same foundational problems repeatedly: authentication, testing infrastructure, database migrations, CI/CD pipelines, and quality gates. Most developers either start from scratch (wasting weeks) or use minimal templates that leave critical infrastructure gaps.

**Worse**, traditional development assumes solo coding. Modern development is **human-AI collaboration**, but existing templates provide no guidance on effectively working with AI assistants like Claude.

## Target Users

### Primary: Solo Developers & Small Teams (1-3 people)

- Building production SaaS applications
- Want to ship fast without cutting corners on quality
- Comfortable with AI pair programming (Claude Code)
- Value automation and guardrails over manual processes

### Secondary: AI-First Developers

- Developers who primarily work through AI assistants
- Need structured workflows to maintain quality with AI
- Want self-improving documentation that prevents repeat mistakes

### Anti-Personas (Who This Is NOT For)

- Developers building static sites (use Astro/Hugo)
- Rapid prototypers who plan to throw away code (too much infrastructure)
- Teams who prefer minimal structure (will fight the opinions)
- Projects without databases (unnecessary complexity)

## Solution: Production-Ready Starter with AI Collaboration Built In

A **Next.js monorepo starter template** that provides:

1. **Complete infrastructure** (auth, testing, DB migrations, CI/CD)
2. **AI collaboration tools** (slash commands, sub-agents, progressive disclosure)
3. **Self-improving docs** (micro-lessons that evolve with your codebase)
4. **Automated quality gates** (pre-commit, pre-push, CI checks)

**Not just a template—a development methodology.**

## Explicit Non-Goals (What's NOT Included)

### Infrastructure Features (Post-MVP)

These are planned for **after** core MVP is stable:

- ⏳ **Payments integration** (Stripe) - Issue #293 (recipe doc exists)
- ⏳ **Email service** (Resend) - Issue #295 (planned)
- ⏳ **AI integration** (Vercel AI SDK) - Issue #294 (OpenAI + Anthropic)
- ⏳ **Internationalization (i18n)** - Issue #296 (next-intl)
- ⏳ **Deployment docs** - Issue #297 (Vercel + Supabase setup)
- ❌ **Multi-tenancy/organizations** - Beyond MVP scope
- ❌ **Advanced auth** (OAuth, SSO, MFA) - Basic email/password sufficient
- ❌ **File uploads** - Add when needed per project
- ❌ **Background jobs** - Add when needed per project

### Testing Features (In Scope for MVP)

These ARE part of MVP (Epic #303 - Autonomous AI-Powered E2E Testing):

- ✅ **Playwright MCP integration** - Already working (manual UI testing)
- ⏳ **Auth E2E tests** - Issue #304 (codify validated flows)
- ⏳ **Playwright native agents** - Issue #305 (planner, generator, healer)
- ⏳ **Self-healing test loop** - Issue #306 (automated PR fixes)
- ⏳ **Visual regression testing** - Issue #307 (screenshot comparison)
- ⏳ **Design token compliance** - Issue #308 (automated enforcement)

**Pragmatic Limits:**

- ❌ **100% code coverage** - 70% target is sufficient
- ❌ **Performance testing** - Add when performance issues arise
- ❌ **Cross-browser E2E** (Chrome only for MVP)

### Documentation (YAGNI)

- ❌ **Comprehensive API docs** - Code comments + TypeScript types sufficient
- ❌ **Video tutorials** - Written docs sufficient
- ❌ **Automated changelog** - Manual release notes sufficient

## Design Principles

### 1. Starter Template First, Production App Second

**Principle**: Keep it simple and demonstrable. Show patterns, don't build the world.

- ✅ One example of auth (email/password)
- ❌ Five auth providers (OAuth, SSO, MFA, etc.)
- ✅ One RLS policy template per table type
- ❌ Complex multi-tenant authorization framework

**Why**: Users will customize. Show them how, don't overwhelm them with options.

### 2. MVP Over Feature Completeness

**Principle**: Build only what's needed for acceptance criteria. Document the rest.

- ✅ Basic secret scanning (Gitleaks defaults + 2 custom rules)
- ❌ 13 custom rules for every possible secret type (use defaults)
- ✅ Pre-push hook runs tests (<15s)
- ❌ Pre-push hook runs tests + E2E + coverage report (too slow)

**Why**: 87% less code to maintain. Users can add complexity when needed.

**Reference**: See micro-lesson `docs/learning/mvp-scope-creep-detection.md`

### 3. AI Collaboration as First-Class Citizen

**Principle**: Optimize for human-AI pair programming, not solo human coding.

- ✅ Slash commands with quality gates built in
- ✅ Command discovery protocol (check commands before native tools)
- ✅ Sub-agents for specialized tasks (cost-optimized with Haiku)
- ❌ Assume developers read all docs and remember all commands

**Why**: Modern development IS AI collaboration. Template should make that excellent.

### 4. Automation Over Documentation

**Principle**: Encode knowledge in scripts and quality gates, not just docs.

- ✅ Doctor checks validate 23 rules on every commit
- ✅ Pre-push hook prevents 100% of lint/type/test failures before CI
- ✅ Migration validation catches destructive operations before deploy
- ❌ "Remember to run tests before pushing" in docs (humans forget)

**Why**: Machines enforce consistently. Humans forget under pressure.

### 5. Progressive Enhancement, Not Big Bang

**Principle**: Ship working features incrementally. Table non-critical enhancements.

- ✅ Auth module: Email/password working end-to-end
- ❌ Auth module: Email/password + OAuth + magic links + MFA (scope creep)
- ✅ Testing: 70% coverage with pragmatic exclusions
- ❌ Testing: 100% coverage with zero exclusions (diminishing returns)

**Why**: Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Iterate based on real usage.

### 6. Convention Over Configuration (With Escape Hatches)

**Principle**: Opinionated defaults, but allow bypass when needed.

- ✅ Pre-push hook runs tests (bypass with `--no-verify`)
- ✅ 70% coverage target (configurable in `vitest.config.ts`)
- ✅ Conventional commits enforced (bypass with `--no-verify`)
- ❌ Zero escape hatches (forces developers to work around system)

**Why**: Guardrails prevent mistakes. Escape hatches prevent frustration.

## Out of Scope (For This PRD)

### Features Documented for Later

These are **not anti-goals**—they're just **not MVP**. Recipe docs or specs exist for future implementation.

- **Stripe payments** - Recipe doc at `docs/recipes/stripe.md`
- **Email service (Resend)** - Planned, not yet implemented
- **Skills system** - Spec complete, implementation deferred
- **Micro-lessons system** - Deprecated, replaced with simpler approach

### True Anti-Goals (Don't Build)

These are things we **explicitly don't want**, even in future phases.

- ❌ **CMS integration** - Out of scope for starter template
- ❌ **GraphQL layer** - REST + tRPC sufficient
- ❌ **Multiple database support** - Supabase (Postgres) only
- ❌ **Mobile app** - Web only
- ❌ **Real-time collaboration features** - Beyond MVP scope

---

## Future Phases (Roadmap Preview)

### Phase 1: Skills System (Deferred)

Progressive disclosure architecture for AI collaboration:

- Metadata (always loaded) → Instructions (on-trigger) → Resources (on-demand)
- 11 built-in Skills (database, testing, git, documentation, etc.)
- 51-90% token reduction for multi-step workflows
- Spec complete, implementation deferred until proven necessary

### Phase 2: Stripe Integration (Planned)

Production-ready payments:

- Subscription management (create, cancel, update)
- Webhook handling with signature verification
- Customer portal integration
- Recipe doc exists at `docs/recipes/stripe.md`

### Phase 3: Email Service (Planned)

Transactional emails via Resend:

- Welcome emails, password reset, notifications
- Template system with brand consistency
- Tracking and analytics integration

### Phase 4: Advanced Auth (Maybe)

Only if strong user demand:

- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Magic link authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
