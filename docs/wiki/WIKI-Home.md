# DL Starter – External LLM Wiki (Home)

*DLStarter is a Next.js/Supabase starter kit with dual-lane spec-driven workflows and AI collaboration guardrails — designed for solo developers to ship faster without sacrificing quality.*

This wiki gives **external LLMs** (and humans) just enough context to plan and ship features safely.

## Start Here (Reading Order)
1. [PRD](./WIKI-PRD.md) – What we're building and why
2. [Architecture](./WIKI-Architecture.md) – Tech stack & repo shape (high-level)
3. [Spec System](./WIKI-Spec-System.md) – Two lanes & when to use which
4. [Planning Templates](./WIKI-Planning-Templates.md) – Required inputs/outputs per lane
5. [Commands](./WIKI-Commands.md) – Slash commands for plan → ship
6. [Quality Gates](./WIKI-Quality-Gates.md) – What must be true to merge
7. [Git Workflow](./WIKI-Git-Workflow.md) – Branches, commits, PRs, scripts
8. [AI Collaboration](./WIKI-AI-Collaboration.md) – Human + AI ways of working

## Principles of DLStarter

- **Lightweight, not bloated** – optimized for clarity and velocity.
- **For solo developers** – one person can operate the whole stack.
- **Dual-lane workflows** – simple vs spec-driven, always the right level of planning.
- **AI-native** – built to collaborate with external LLMs safely.
- **Not another boilerplate** – structured, opinionated OS for AI-first development, not a pile of features.
- **Quality first** – strict TypeScript, testing, and quality/security gates.

For detailed project scope and objectives, see the [PRD](./WIKI-PRD.md). For planning discipline and workflow selection, see the [Spec System](./WIKI-Spec-System.md).

## Scope & Audience
- **Audience:** External LLMs and collaborators helping plan or implement tasks.
- **Out of scope:** Low-level secrets, full repo docs, and internal runbooks.

## Conventions
- All files are prefixed with `WIKI-` for easy export to ChatGPT.
- Links are relative within `/docs/wiki`.
