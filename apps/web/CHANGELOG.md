### Patch Changes

- **Learning Loop System v1.0**: Comprehensive micro-lessons tracking with heat ranking
  - **Zero-ceremony learning capture**: 90-second micro-lessons with template automation
  - **Smart heat ranking**: Switches from recency to usage+severity scoring at 8+ events
  - **Game-proof scoring**: Bounded reuse (≤3×) and severity (0-2) to prevent gaming
  - **Portable template**: 5-minute deployment package for other repos
  - **CI integration**: JSON metrics, idempotent PR comments, 4-week trend display
  - **Retention automation**: Archiving rules and template sync validation

  This establishes the foundation for systematic learning capture across projects, with LLMs as teammates that learn from accumulated micro-lessons.
