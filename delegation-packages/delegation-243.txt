=== DELEGATION PACKAGE FOR ISSUE #243 ===

Please implement this following our project standards.

## Issue Details

**#243**: Add AI usage annotation to PR template

## Problem

The current PR template lacks transparency about AI-generated code, making it difficult for reviewers to:
- Know which code requires extra scrutiny
- Understand the extent of AI assistance used
- Apply appropriate review rigor based on AI involvement
- Track AI usage patterns across the team

**Source:** AI-Augmented SDLC research recommendations (GPT-5 prompt review)

## Impact

- **P1 (High)**: Critical for AI-assisted development transparency
- Reviewers can't adjust their approach based on AI involvement
- Missing data for measuring AI effectiveness
- Risk of lower scrutiny on AI-generated code that needs more review

## Current State

- ✅ Comprehensive PR template with quality checks
- ✅ AI Review Status section (but advisory only)
- ❌ No field indicating % of AI-generated code
- ❌ No tracking of which parts used AI assistance
- ❌ No guidance on what constitutes "AI assistance"

## Solution

Add explicit AI usage annotation field to PR template.

### Proposed Addition

Update [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md):

```markdown
## AI Assistance Disclosure

**AI Assistance Used:** ☐ None / ☐ Minimal (<25%) / ☐ Moderate (25-75%) / ☐ Significant (>75%)

**AI-Generated Components:** _(List specific files/functions that were primarily AI-generated)_
- 

**AI Tools Used:** _(e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)_
- 

**Human Review Applied:**
- [ ] All AI-generated code reviewed line-by-line
- [ ] Edge cases manually tested
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance implications validated

**Notes:** _(Optional: Describe AI workflow, prompt strategies, or lessons learned)_
```

### Alternative: Simple Percentage Field

Minimal version:

```markdown
## AI Assistance

**Estimated AI contribution:** ____%

_List components with significant AI generation:_
- 

_All AI-generated code has been reviewed and tested manually: ☐ Yes_
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PR template updated with AI usage field
- [ ] Guidance added on what counts as "AI assistance"
- [ ] Example PR created demonstrating proper disclosure
- [ ] Team notified of new requirement
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated with AI disclosure expectations
- [ ] Decision documented (full version vs minimal version)

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Reviewers know what to scrutinize
2. **Context**: Understanding AI involvement helps with review approach
3. **Metrics**: Track AI effectiveness and patterns over time
4. **Quality**: Encourages proper human review of AI code
5. **Learning**: Share successful AI workflows through notes
6. **Compliance**: Demonstrates responsible AI usage practices

## Guidance on "AI Assistance"

Create `docs/ai/AI_DISCLOSURE_GUIDE.md`:

**Counts as AI Assistance:**
- Code generated by AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- Significant refactoring suggested by AI
- Architecture/design decisions guided by AI
- Test generation via AI tools

**Does NOT count:**
- Autocomplete/IntelliSense
- Simple code formatting
- Grammar/spell-check in comments
- Documentation typo fixes

**Estimation Guidelines:**
- **None (0%)**: Wrote everything manually
- **Minimal (<25%)**: AI helped with boilerplate or suggestions
- **Moderate (25-75%)**: AI generated structure, human refined
- **Significant (>75%)**: Primarily AI-generated, human reviewed

## Integration with Existing Checks

Update PR template checklist:

```markdown
## Verification

- [ ] `pnpm run doctor:report` (attach artifacts/doctor-report.md)
- [ ] AI assistance disclosed (if applicable)
- [ ] All AI-generated code reviewed manually
...
```

# Add AI usage annotation to PR template

## Summary

Add explicit AI usage disclosure field to the PR template to provide transparency about AI-generated code, enabling reviewers to apply appropriate scrutiny and track AI effectiveness across the team.

## Problem Statement

The current PR template lacks transparency about AI-generated code, making it difficult for reviewers to:
- Know which code requires extra scrutiny
- Understand the extent of AI assistance used
- Apply appropriate review rigor based on AI involvement
- Track AI usage patterns across the team

While we have an "AI Review Status" section, it's advisory only and doesn't capture:
- Percentage of AI-generated code
- Which specific components used AI assistance
- What constitutes "AI assistance" (unclear definition)

**Impact:** P1 (High) - Critical for AI-assisted development transparency and responsible AI usage practices.

## Proposed Solution

Add a new "AI Assistance Disclosure" section to `.github/pull_request_template.md` with structured fields for:
1. **AI contribution percentage** (None/Minimal/Moderate/Significant)
2. **AI-generated components** (specific files/functions)
3. **AI tools used** (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
4. **Human review checklist** (line-by-line review, testing, security validation)
5. **Optional notes** (workflow lessons, prompt strategies)

**Two proposed formats:**

### Full Version (Recommended):
```markdown
## AI Assistance Disclosure

**AI Assistance Used:** ☐ None / ☐ Minimal (<25%) / ☐ Moderate (25-75%) / ☐ Significant (>75%)

**AI-Generated Components:** _(List specific files/functions that were primarily AI-generated)_
-

**AI Tools Used:** _(e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)_
-

**Human Review Applied:**
- [ ] All AI-generated code reviewed line-by-line
- [ ] Edge cases manually tested
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance implications validated

**Notes:** _(Optional: Describe AI workflow, prompt strategies, or lessons learned)_
```

### Minimal Version:
```markdown
## AI Assistance

**Estimated AI contribution:** ____%

_List components with significant AI generation:_
-

_All AI-generated code has been reviewed and tested manually: ☐ Yes_
```

**Decision:** Full version recommended for comprehensive tracking and learning.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.github/pull_request_template.md` updated with AI Assistance Disclosure section
- [ ] Section placed after "AI Review Status" section (logical grouping)
- [ ] Guidance document created: `docs/ai/AI_DISCLOSURE_GUIDE.md` defining:
  - What counts as "AI assistance" vs what doesn't
  - Estimation guidelines (None/Minimal/Moderate/Significant)
  - Examples of proper disclosure
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated to reference AI disclosure as required step
- [ ] Example PR created demonstrating proper disclosure
- [ ] Team notified of new requirement via GitHub discussion or Slack
- [ ] PR template passes markdown linting (pnpm lint)
- [ ] Documentation follows project markdown standards (code blocks with language identifiers)

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing PR template structure and checklist format
- Must align with existing AI disclosure footer pattern: "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)"
- Should not significantly increase PR creation time (keep concise)
- Must be compatible with PR autofill GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/pr-autofill.yml`)
- Should support future automation (e.g., metrics collection from AI disclosure data)

## Success Metrics

- 100% of PRs include AI disclosure section (measured via PR template compliance)
- Reviewers report increased confidence in review approach based on AI disclosure
- Zero incidents of AI-generated code being rubber-stamped without proper review
- Team shares AI workflow learnings through optional notes field
- Metrics available for tracking AI effectiveness over time

## Out of Scope

- Automated detection of AI-generated code (future tooling)
- AI usage analytics dashboard (separate feature)
- Integration with AI tool APIs for automatic disclosure (vendor-specific)
- Enforcement mechanisms beyond manual checklist (future automation)
- Comprehensive AI ethics guidelines (separate documentation)

## Scope

- [ ] Single task type (feature/refactor/test/docs)
- [ ] Only touched files listed in docs/llm/context-map.json

## AI Review Status

- [ ] **AI Review:** ⚠️ Not requested / ✅ Requested (`@claude /review`)
- [ ] **Security Scan:** ⚠️ Not applicable / ✅ Completed automatically

_If AI review completed, paste advisory feedback summary from doctor report below:_

```
[Paste "🤖 AI Review (Advisory)" or "🛡️ AI Security Review (Advisory)" sections from artifacts/doctor-report.md]
```

## Verification

Paste real outputs or "OK":

- [ ] `pnpm run doctor:report` (attach artifacts/doctor-report.md)
- [ ] `pnpm -w turbo run lint`
- [ ] `pnpm -w turbo run typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm -w turbo run build`
- [ ] `pnpm -w turbo run test:e2e` (or N/A)
- [ ] `pnpm audit:traceability` (if using specs/plans/tasks)
- [ ] `pnpm tsx scripts/docs-check.ts` (docs-link-check)
- [ ] `pnpm learn:index` (if micro-lessons changed)

_💡 **Tip**: If doctor checks fail due to timing issues, comment `/doctor recheck` to manually re-run (maintainers/write access only)._

## Doctor & Quality Checks

- [ ] I ran `pnpm doctor` locally (no fails)
- [ ] All referenced scripts/paths in my changed docs exist
- [ ] New `.claude/commands/*` files are linked in `docs/ai/CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] If I intentionally left placeholders, I added them to `.doctor-allowlist.json` (with comment why)
- [ ] Prompt files have required headers (Intent, Inputs, Expected Output, Risks/Guardrails)
- [ ] Doc files have H1, summary, and "When to use" sections
- [ ] No tracked files in artifacts/ directory

## Learning Loop

- [ ] **Learning reference:** Checked docs/micro-lessons/INDEX.md for relevant patterns
- [ ] **Pattern application:** Applied relevant micro-lessons to avoid known issues
- [ ] **New learning:** Created/updated micro-lesson if new pattern emerged
- [ ] **Saved rework:** Micro-lesson prevented significant debugging/refactoring time

Common patterns to check (as applicable):

- [ ] Isolation hooks checked (no hidden state coupling)
- [ ] Mock at the **boundary** (env/config or network), not deep internals
- [ ] Stable React keys (no array indices)
- [ ] Dead code removed (no unreachable branches after early returns)
- [ ] Async assertions use Testing Library's `waitFor*` (no flake‑prone timeouts)
- [ ] Memoize expensive values/objects in render paths

Refs:

- Top‑10 Index: docs/micro-lessons/INDEX.md
- Template: docs/micro-lessons/template.md

## LLM Guardrails

- [ ] Used adapters (no vendor SDKs in UI)
- [ ] No hardcoded hex colors (tokenized Tailwind only)
- [ ] Updated docs and `llm/context-map.json` if scripts/paths changed

## Used Micro-Lesson

_Optional: reference any micro-lesson that helped avoid an issue (e.g., test-isolation-hooks)_

## Breaking changes / Migration

_None_ (or describe + steps)
